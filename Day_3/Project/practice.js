//1. The following function returns true if the parameter age is greater than 18.
// Otherwise it asks for a confirmation and returns its result:

function checkAge(age) {
  if (age > 18) {
    return true;
  } else {
    // ...
    return confirm('Did parents allow you?');
  }
}
// Will the function work differently if else is removed?

function checkAge(age) {

    return true;
  }
  // ...
  return confirm('Did parents allow you?');

// Is there any difference in the behavior of these two variants?

// Using OR ||



// Write a function pow(x,n) that returns x in power n. Or, in other words, multiplies x by itself n times and returns the result.
// pow(3, 2) = 3 * 3 = 9
// pow(3, 3) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27
// pow(1, 100) = 1 * 1 * ...* 1 = 1
// Use prompt to take values for x and n, and then shows the result of pow(x,n) using alert.
// In this task the function should support only natural values of n: integers up from 1.



// Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

// Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

// Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.

// Show the following output using one loop.
    // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    // 6, 7, 8, 9, 10


// Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.

// Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.

// Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

// Modify the previous program such that only multiples of 5 or 7 are considered in the sum, e.g. n = 20 (5,7,10,14,15,20) 71

// Write a program that takes a number under (25) and prints the multiplication table for the number.
